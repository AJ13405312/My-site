    <h3>Hey MJ 😊,</h3>
    <p>
      So 2nd Feb was one of those days the world got better just because you were born. Who can forget that beautiful day.<br><br>

      You make things lighter — conversations easier, laughter more natural, and moments more meaningful.
      You are one of those rare people who feels like comfort and excitement at the same time, and honestly… that’s a beautiful thing, right?<br><br>

      It was not not just about cake and candles 🕯️🎂  
      It was about celebrating you — your heart, your smile, your energy, your kindness, your madness😄 <em>just kidding</em> 😄<br><br>
                <strong>Anyway dream girl!</strong><br><br>
      May this new year bring you:<br>
      ✨ Peace that feels like home<br>
      ✨ Wins you do not have to force<br>
      ✨ Love you do not have to question<br>
      ✨ <strong>Happiness that stays.</strong><br><br>
    </p>
